1. dplyr

STEP 1
----------
The UCI Har Dataset explains the following:
1. subject_test.txt contains the test subject's identifying number
2. X_test.txt contains A '561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables'
3. y_test.txt contains the activity label
Each file contains one observation per row - 2947 observations (rows).

These three files are combined into a single data table.

The same is done for the training data files (subject_train.txt, X_train.txt, y_train.txt).

The file features.txt contains the column names that describes each of the 561 features of each observation - this file will be used to provide descriptive variable labels.

----------
STEP 2
----------
Our dataset only needs to contain the mean and standard deviation measures for each observation.

The UCI HAR Dataset Explains that mean and standard deviation measures can be identified by the following signals.
  mean(): Mean value
  std(): Standard deviation

The mean and standard deviation measures are extracted from the merged test and training dataset, excluding all other features of each observation.

----------
STEP 3
----------
The UCI HAR Dataset does not descriptively name each activity performed by a subject, but assigns a number according to activity - the numbers for each activity can be found in the activity_labels.txt file.

The merged dataset is updated to replace the activity number with a descriptive name for each activity, based on the acitivyt_lables.txt file.

----------
STEP 4
----------
The final step is to produce a second tidy data set, with a single row for each subject's activity, and the mean of each of the activities observation factors.

This dataset is a separate text file outputed to the same working directory.
